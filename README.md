# 📐 Wireframing

## 🧾 What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, app, or digital interface. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality without the distraction of colors, fonts, or images.

Think of a wireframe as a blueprint for your digital product — it shows where elements like headers, navigation menus, content blocks, buttons, and images will be placed.

## 🎯 Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing is a critical first step in the UI/UX design process for several reasons:

- **Clarity of Structure**: Helps designers and stakeholders understand the layout and flow before adding visual elements.
- **Early Feedback**: Facilitates discussions and feedback early in the project, reducing costly revisions later.
- **User-Centered Focus**: Prioritizes content and user experience by laying out key elements in a logical order.
- **Efficient Prototyping**: Speeds up development by offering a clear roadmap for developers and designers.
